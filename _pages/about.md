I am a first-year M.S. student in the Department of *Electrical and Computer Engineering* at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC) advised by Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). I obtained my B.S. degree in 2021 from UIUC with major in *Computer Engineering*. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). Previously, I worked in the FORWARD Lab led by Prof. [Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang](http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang). 

My current research interest is in machine learning. In particular, I am recently working on projects about Vision Language Model and multi-task learning. Besides that, my research interests also lie in computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning.
