I am a *Computer Engineering* B.S. graduted from the Department of *Electrical and Computer Engineering* at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). Previously, I worked in the FORWARD Lab led by Prof. [Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang](http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang). 

My current research interest is in machine learning. In particular, I am recently working on projects about domain generalization and deep representation learning and their applications in federated learning and signal precessing. Besides that, my research interests also lie in computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning.
