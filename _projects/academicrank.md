- Worked in the FORWARD Data Lab with professor Kevin Chang; Conducted research on calculating the rank of academic works about a given keyword according to their importance;

- Formalized the task into a weighted Personalized PageRank problem with multiple nodes values; Re-processed 3 datasets for the task to shrink the data size and speed up calculation;

- Designed a fast-ranking algorithm that works on citation relation graphs that can calculate the ranking of a graph with more than 10 billion edges in about 1 hour; Generated convincing results.
