- Designed & coded car chasing game on FPGA board using System Verilog for game logic and C for keyboard communication;

- Implemented a playerâ€™s car as the chaser, an AI car as the target and car streams in different direction and with different speeds as obstacles; Realized collision detection so that the AI car can avoid obstacles autonomously.
