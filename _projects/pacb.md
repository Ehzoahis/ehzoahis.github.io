-	Proposed a novel self-supervised training scheme to better leverage the large corpus of unlabeled audio data; Designed a problem-agnostic cluster-based pretext task to pretrain the feature extractor;

-	Tested the scheme on source separation and speaker classification datasets; the models converge faster and result in higher accuracy in both tasks.
