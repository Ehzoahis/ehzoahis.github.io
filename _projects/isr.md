**This project is targeting ICML2022.**

- Worked with Professor Han Zhao and Professor Bo Li on domain generalization; Purposed a novel post-processing method to recover the invariant subspace of features and improve the robustness of models;

- Tested the algorithm on both synthetic and real-world image datasets for domain generalization; Outperformed the algorithms including IRM and Group-DRO.
